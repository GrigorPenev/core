## Overview

This tutorial will show you how to use **Glue42 Core** features in your applications using the [`@glue42/react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/react-hooks) package. The applications used in the tutorial are Progressive Web Apps which work both in the browser and on the desktop (after installation). The tutorial includes two applications, **Clients** and **Stocks**, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The applications have 3 views (windows):

- **Clients** - displays a list of clients. Will be accessible at `http://localhost:4242/clients`;
- **Stocks** - displays a list of stocks. Will be accessible at `http://localhost:4242/stocks`;
- **Stock Details** - displays details for a stock after the user clicks on a stock in the **Stocks** app. Will be accessible at `http://localhost:4242/details`;

As an end result, the users want to be able to run two apps as Progressive Web Apps in separate windows in order to take advantage of their multi-monitor setups. Also, they want the apps, even though in separate windows, to be able to communicate with each other. For example, when a client is selected in the **Clients** app, the **Stocks** app should display only the stocks of the selected client.

## Prerequisites

## Tutorial Structure

The tutorial code is located in the **Glue42 Core** [**GitHub repo**](https://github.com/Glue42/core). There you will find a `/tutorials` directory with the following structure:

```cmd
/tutorials
    /angular
        /solution
        /start
    /guides
        /02_core
            /01_javascript
            /02_react
            /03_angular
    /javascript
        /solution
        /start
    /react
        /solution
        /start
    /rest-server
```

- `/guides` - contains the text files of the tutorials;
- `/javascript`, `/react` and `/angular` - contain the starting files for the tutorials and also a full solution for each of them;
- `/rest-server` - a simple server used in the tutorials to serve the necessary `JSON` data;

**Glue42 Core** is an open-source project, so all feedback and contributions, both to the code base and the tutorials, are welcome.

The tutorial consists of several parts, each one demonstrating different **Glue42 Core** capabilities. Each part depends on completing the previous ones.

## 1. Setup

Clone the **Glue42 Core** [**GitHub repo**](https://github.com/Glue42/core) to get the tutorial files.

### 1.1. Start Files

The React tutorial files are located in the `/tutorials/react` directory. Go to the `/start` directory which contains the starting files for the project. The tutorial examples assume that you will be working in the `/start` directory, but, of course, you can move the files and work from another directory.

The `/start` directory contains the following:

- `Clients` - the **Clients** app bootstrapped with CRA;
- `Stocks` - the **Stocks** app bootstrapped with CRA;
- `index.html` - the project landing page;

The **Clients** and **Stocks** apps contain the following resources:

- `/public` - holds static assets for each application, including a `manifest.json`, `sw.js` (Service Worker), icons and an `index.html` file;
- `/src` - holds the main entry point - `index.js`, and the `Clients.jsx`/`Stocks.jsx` react component. Also, a `glue.js` file (methods for interaction with the Glue42 framework), CSS files and a `serviceWorker` file which only registers the Service Worker for the app;
- `.env` - environment variables for CRA;
- `config-overrides.js` - defines additional WebPack configuration to resolve `react` and `react-dom` modules from within the `node_modules` in the current directory;

Go to the directories of both apps (`/start/Clients` and `/start/Stocks`), open a command prompt and run:

```cmd
npm install

npm start
```

This will install all necessary dependencies and will run the **Clients** app on port 3000 and the **Stocks** app on port 3001. The pages will reload whenever you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### 1.2. Solution Files

Before you continue, take a look at the solution files. You are free to use the solution as you like - you can check after each section to see how it solves the problem, or you can use it as a reference point in case you get stuck.

Go to the `/rest-server` directory and start the REST Server (as described in the [REST Server](#setup-rest_server) chapter). 

Install all dependencies in `/react/solution/Clients` and `/react/solution/Stocks` and start both apps by running the following commands: 

```cmd
npm install

npm start
```

Go to the `/react/solution` directory, open a command prompt and run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies and run the project (assuming the Glue42 CLI is installed globally):

```cmd
npm install

gluec serve
```

You can now access the **Clients** app at `localhost:4242/clients` and the **Stocks** app at `localhost:4242/stocks`.

### 1.3. REST Server

Before starting with the project, go to the `/tutorials/rest-server` directory and start the REST server that will host the necessary data for the applications:

```cmd
npm install

npm start
```

This will launch the server at port 8080.

### 1.4. Glue42 Environment

Now, you will use the [**Glue42 CLI**](../../../core/core-concepts/cli/index.html) to set up the [Glue42 Environment](../../../core/core-concepts/environment/overview/index.html) files. For that purpose, you need to install the Glue42 CLI and run the `init` command which will automatically set up your development environment. Go to the `/tutorials/react/start` directory, open a command prompt and run the following:

```cmd
npm install --global @glue42/cli-core

gluec init
```
Or you can also do it this way:

```cmd
npm install --save-dev @glue42/cli-core

npx gluec init
```

The `init` command installs the necessary dependencies and creates the necessary configuration files with default settings. 

Next, you have to configure the development server that comes with the Glue42 CLI. It will allow you to serve or proxy to your apps, define shared resources and serve the [**Glue42 Environment**](../../../glue42-core/what-is-glue42-core/core-concepts/environment/index.html) files correctly. To do that, open the `glue.config.dev.json` file that was created with the `init` command and add the locations and routes for the shared resources and the **Clients** and **Stocks** apps. Your configuration should look something like this:

```json
{
    "glueAssets": ...,
    "server": {
        "settings": ...,
        "apps": [
            {
                "route": "/",
                "file": {
                    "path": "./"
                }
            },
            {
                "route": "/clients",
                "localhost": {
                  "port": 3000
                }
            },
            {
                "route": "/stocks",
                "localhost": {
                  "port": 3001
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    "logging": "dev"
}
```

*For more information on how to configure the Glue42 CLI development server, see the [Glue42 CLI: Configuration](../../../core/core-concepts/cli/index.html#configuration) section.*

Now, go to the root directory of each app and run:

```cmd
npm start
```

Next, open a command prompt in the project base directory and run:

```cmd
gluec serve
```

The `serve` command launches a development server at port 4242 which will serve all defined apps and resources together with the [**Glue42 Environment**](../../../glue42-core/what-is-glue42-core/core-concepts/environment/index.html) files.

Now, you can open the apps at `localhost:4242/clients` for the **Clients** app and at `localhost:4242/stocks` for the **Stocks** app or access them directly from the project landing page at `localhost:4242/`.

Landing page:

![Landing Page](../../../images/tutorials/core-react/landing-page.png)

Clients:

![Clients](../../../images/tutorials/core-react/clients.png)

Stocks:

![Stocks](../../../images/tutorials/core-react/stocks.png)

At the right side of the address bar you will see an install icon from which you can install the app on your desktop:

![Install](../../../images/tutorials/core-js/install.png)

Once installed, you can launch it from the shortcut created on your desktop or by going to `chrome://apps` (if you are using Google Chrome) and clicking its icon.

#### Serving from the File System

Additionally, there are use cases where you may want to serve the apps from the file system instead of using the WebPack development servers. This is thoroughly covered in the [Glue42 CLI](../../../core/core-concepts/cli/index.html#configuration), but you can see the quick steps to do that below:

- Go to the directories of the **Clients** and **Stocks** applications, open a command prompt and run:

```cmd
npm run build
```

- In the `glue.config.dev.json` config file (that was generated by the `gluec init` command) replace the `localhost` property with `file`:

```json
{
    "glueAssets": ...,
    "server": {
        "settings": ...,
        "apps": [
            {
                "route": "/clients",
                // Replace `localhost` with `file` and specify the path to the app.
                "file": {
                    "path": "./Clients/build/"
                }
            },
            {
                "route": "/stocks",
                "file": {
                    "path": "./Stocks/build/"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    "logging": "dev"
}
```

- Restart the Glue42 CLI by quitting it and running the `gluec serve` command again.

Note that if you go with this approach, you will have to rebuild the **Clients** and **Stocks** applications every time you make changes.

### 1.5. React Project Setup

This tutorial starts with two main applications. As the user requirements change, however, your **Glue42 Core** project will expand with more applications. Here you will learn how to create a new React application and set it up correctly in order to enable it to work with **Glue42 Core**. When you have to create and set up new apps later on in the tutorial, you can refer back to this chapter and follow the steps below to ensure that your app has been configured properly:

1. Go to the directory where you want your new app to be created, open a command prompt and run the following command replacing `my-app` with the name of your app:

```cmd
npx create-react-app my-app
```

2. Install the following dependencies in the root directory of your app:

```cmd
npm i --save @glue42/react-hooks@1.0.7 react-select@3.1.0 bootstrap@4.4.1 react-app-rewired@2.1.5 chroma-js@2.1.0
```

3. Edit the `package.json` file of your app:

- add a `homepage` property replacing `my-app` with the name of your app:

```json
"homepage": "/my-app/"
```

- change the `start`, `build` and `test` scripts to the following:

```json
"start": "react-app-rewired start --scripts-version react-scripts",
"build": "react-app-rewired build --scripts-version react-scripts",
"test": "react-app-rewired test --scripts-version react-scripts",
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your app with the following settings:

```cmd
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
PORT=3002
```

*Note that the `PORT` value must be different for each app in the project.*

5. Go to the root directory of one of the existing tutorial apps, copy the `config-overrides.js` file and paste it in the root directory of your app.

6. Go to the `glue.config.dev.json` file in the root directory of your **Glue42 Core** project and add the details for the new application in the `apps` array. Replace `my-app` with the route to your app and the port number with the port you have defined for your app in the `.env` file:

```json
"server": {
    ...
    "apps": [
        ...,
        {
            "route": "/my-app",
            "localhost": {
                "port": 3002
            }
        }
    ],
    ...
}
```

Restart the Glue42 CLI by quitting it and running the `gluec serve` command again for the changes to take effect. 

7. Start your app by running the following command from its root directory:

```cmd 
npm start
```

8. Create or edit the code for the new app by following the specific instructions in the respective chapters.

## 2. Initializing the Glue42 Web Library

Now, you need to initialize the [**Glue42 Web**](../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library in each of the components. 

First, install the Glue42 React Hooks libraries for both applications:

```cmd
npm install --save @glue42/react-hooks
```

Next, in the `index.js` files of both apps import the factory function from `@glue42/web` and pass it to the `GlueProvider`:

```javascript
import GlueWeb from "@glue42/web";
import { GlueProvider } from "@glue42/react-hooks";
```

Wrap the `App` component with the `GlueProvider` component so you can consume the `glue` object later:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
    <GlueProvider glueFactory={GlueWeb}>
        <App />
    </GlueProvider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

In all three components (`Client.jsx`, `Stocks.jsx`, `StockDetails.jsx`), import `GlueContext` and `useGlue` from the `@glue42/react-hooks` library and the `useContext` React hook so that you can get the `glue` object from the context inside the components:

```javascript
import { useContext } from "react";
import { GlueContext, useGlue } from "@glue42/react-hooks";
```

The following JSX code will allow the components to show whether the Glue42 framework is available or not. Add the code in all three components and place it in the `return` statement inside the `<div className="container-fluid">` element:

```javascript
return (
    <div className="container-fluid">
        <div className="row">
            <div className="col-md-2">
                {!glue && (
                <span id="glueSpan" className="badge badge-warning">
                    Glue42 is unavailable
                </span>
                )}
                {glue && (
                <span id="glueSpan" className="badge badge-success">
                    Glue42 is available
                </span>
                )}
            </div>
            <div className="col-md-8">
                <h1 className="text-center">Clients</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        ...
    </div>
);
```

Initialize the Glue42  Web library in all three components:

```javascript
// Clients.jsx
function Clients() {
    const glue = useContext(GlueContext);
};

// Stocks.jsx
function Stocks() {
    const glue = useContext(GlueContext);
};

// StockDetails.jsx
function StockDetails() {
    const glue = useContext(GlueContext);
};
```

You should now be able to see a small green label at the top left corner of your apps with the text "Glue42 is available".

## 3. Interop

In this section you will use some of the functionalities provided by the **Glue42 Core** [**Interop API**](../../../reference/core/latest/interop/index.html).

### 3.1. Method Registration

When a user clicks on a client, the **Stocks** app should show only the stocks owned by this client. You can achieve this by registering an Interop method in the **Stocks** app which, when invoked, will receive the portfolio of the selected client and re-render the stocks table. Also, the **Stocks** app will create an Interop stream to which the new stock prices will be pushed. The **Stocks** and **Stock Details** apps will subscribe to the stream to get notified when new prices have been generated.

Define a callback for registering an Interop method in the `glue.js` file of the **Stocks** app:

```javascript
import { SET_CLIENT_METHOD } from "./constants";

export const registerSetClientMethod = (setClient) => (glue) => {
    // Register an Interop method by providing a name and a handler.
    glue.interop.register(SET_CLIENT_METHOD, setClient);
};
```
Import the callback in the `Stocks.jsx` component and use the `useGlue()` hook  to register the Interop method by passing the `setClient()` method from the `useState()` hook. The `useGlue()` hook will internally invoke the callback and will pass the `glue` object as an argument.

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";
import { registerSetClientMethod } from "./glue";

function Stocks() {
    const [{ clientId, clientName }, setClient] = useState({});
    useGlue(registerSetClientMethod(setClient));
};
```

Modify the `fetchPortfolio()` function inside the existing `useEffect()` hook to fetch the selected client portfolio. Pass `clientId` as a `useEffect()` dependency, so that `fetchPortfolio()` will be called whenever a new client is selected and the component is re-rendered:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    const fetchPortfolio = async () => {
        try {
            const url = `http://localhost:8080${clientId ? `/api/portfolio/${clientId}` : "/api/portfolio"}`;
            const response = await fetch(url, REQUEST_OPTIONS);
            const portfolio = await response.json();
            setPortfolio(portfolio);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(error);
        };
    };
    fetchPortfolio();
}, [clientId]);
```

Finally, add an element to show the client name and ID above the stocks table in the `return` statement of the `Stocks` component.

```javascript
{clientId && (
    <h2 className="p-3">
        Client {clientName} - {clientId}
    </h2>
)}
```

### 3.2. Method Discovery and Invocation

Now, you need to invoke the registered Interop method from the **Clients** app every time the user clicks a client row in the clients table. Again, you will use the `useGlue()` hook to compose a handler which will invoke the Interop method. Before calling the method, you will also check if the method is has been registered (i.e., whether the **Stock** app is running).

In the `glue.js` file of the **Clients** app define a callback that will invoke the Interop method:

```javascript
import { SET_CLIENT_METHOD } from "./constants";

export const setClientPortfolioInterop = (glue) => ({ clientId, clientName }) => {
    // Check whether the method exists.
    const isMethodRegistered = glue.interop
        .methods()
        .some(({ name }) => name === SET_CLIENT_METHOD.name);
    if (isMethodRegistered) {
        // Invoke an Interop method by name and provide arguments for the invocation.
        glue.interop.invoke(SET_CLIENT_METHOD.name, { clientId, clientName });
    };
};
```

Import the callback in the `Clients.jsx` component and pass it to the `useGlue()` hook to define an `onClick()` handler function that you will attach to every client table row:

```javascript
import { setClientPortfolioInterop } from "./glue";

function Clients() {
    const onClick = useGlue(setClientPortfolioInterop);
};
```

In the `return` statement, attach the `onClick()` handler to every client row:

```javascript
<tbody>
    {clients.map(({ name, pId, gId, accountManager, portfolio }) => (
        <tr
            key={pId}
            onClick={() => onClick({ clientId: gId, clientName: name })}
        >
            <td>{name}</td>
            <td>{pId}</td>
            <td>{gId}</td>
            <td>{accountManager}</td>
        </tr>
    ))}
</tbody>
```

Now when you click on a client in the **Clients** app, the **Stocks** app should display only the stocks that are in the portfolio of the selected client.

### 3.3. Creating Streams and Publishing Data

Now, you will create an Interop stream from the **Stocks** app to which new stock prices will be published at a set interval. The **Stocks** and the **Stock Details** apps will subscribe to that stream to show real time stock price updates. The prices will be generated by the predefined `publishInstrumentPrice()` function in the `glue.js` file of the **Stocks** app.

First, go to the `glue.js` file of the **Stocks** app and define a callback that will create the Interop stream. The `glue.interop.createStream()` method returns a `Stream` object which will be passed to the `publishInstrumentPrice()` handler:

```javascript
import { SET_PRICES_STREAM } from "./constants";

export const createInstrumentStream = (glue) => {
    const stream = await glue.interop.createStream(SET_PRICES_STREAM);
    publishInstrumentPrice(stream);
};
```

Next, you have to modify the `publishInstrumentPrice()` callback to use the `push()` method of the `Stream` object to push the generated prices to the stream:

```javascript
export const publishInstrumentPrice = (stream) => {
    setInterval(() => {
        const stocks = {
            ...
        };

        // Push the stock prices to the stream.
        stream.push(stocks);
    }, 1500);
};
```

Finally, go to the `Stocks.jsx` component and create the stream with the `useGlue()` hook:

```javascript
import { useGlue } from "@glue42/react-hooks";
import { createInstrumentStream } from "./glue";

function Stocks() {
    useGlue(createInstrumentStream);
};
```

### 3.4. Stream Subscription

To consume the data from the created Interop stream, you have to create stream subscriptions in the **Stocks** and the **Stock Details** apps.

Go to the `glue.js` file of the **Stocks** app to define a callback that will create a stream subscription. This callback will receive as parameters a `handler` function responsible for updating the stock prices in the component context, and a stock `symbol`, which may be an array of stocks or a single stock depending on whether the callback has been invoked by the **Stocks** or the **Stock Details** app:

```javascript
export const subscribeForInstrumentStream = (handler) => async (glue, symbol) => {
    if (symbol) {
        // Create a stream subscription.
        const subscription = await glue.interop.subscribe(SET_PRICES_STREAM);
        const handleUpdates = ({ data: stocks }) => {
            if (stocks[symbol]) {
                handler(stocks[symbol]);
            } else if (Array.isArray(symbol)) {
                handler(stocks);
            };
        };
        // Specify a handler for new data.
        subscription.onData(handleUpdates);
        // Specify a handler if the subscription fails.
        subscription.onFailed(console.log);

        return subscription;
    }
};
```

Go to the `Stocks.jsx` component and create a stream subscription. The stream used in the tutorial publishes all possible stock prices and it is not necessary to close and renew the subscription when a new client has been selected. However, in a real project scenario, you will have to do exactly that. That is why, this is reflected in the code below. You have to pass the `portfolio` as a dependency of the `useGlue()` hook to trigger a new subscription every time the `portfolio` has been updated:

```javascript
import { subscribeForInstrumentStream } from "./glue";

function Stocks() {
    ...
    // The prices will be updated when new data is received from the stream.
    const [prices, setPrices] = useState({});
    // Create a stream subscription that will be renewed every time the `portfolio` changes.
    const subscription = useGlue(
        (glue, portfolio) => {
            if (portfolio.length > 0) {
                return subscribeForInstrumentStream(setPrices)(glue, portfolio);
            }
        },
        [portfolio]
    );

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchPortfolio = async () => {
            try {
                // Close the existing subscription when a new client has been selected.
                subscription &&
                typeof subscription.close === "function" &&
                subscription.close();

                const url = `http://localhost:8080${clientId ? `/api/portfolio/${clientId}` : "/api/portfolio"}`;
                const response = await fetch(url, REQUEST_OPTIONS);
                const portfolio = await response.json();
                setPortfolio(portfolio);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(error);
            };
        };
        fetchPortfolio();
    }, [clientId]);
    ...
};
```

Update the code for displaying the `Ask` and `Bid` prices by taking their values from `prices` variable that is updated when new data is received from the stream:

```javascript
return (
    ...
        <tbody>
            {portfolio.map(({ RIC, Description, Bid, Ask, ...rest }) => (
                <tr
                    onClick={() => showStockDetails({ RIC, Description, Bid, Ask, ...rest })}
                    key={RIC}
                >
                    <td>{RIC}</td>
                    <td>{Description && Description.toUpperCase()}</td>
                    <td className="text-right">
                        {prices[RIC] ? prices[RIC].Bid : Bid}
                    </td>
                    <td className="text-right">
                        {prices[RIC] ? prices[RIC].Ask : Ask}
                    </td>
                </tr>
            ))}
        </tbody>
    ...
);
```

Now you should see the stock prices (last 2 columns) update at regular intervals.

Finally, extract `Bid` and `Ask` to **Stock Details**' state (`setPrices`) and create a stream subscription there as well by passing the `setPrices` method as a handler for the new stream data and the `RIC` to target the stock for which to get the prices. 

```javascript
import { subscribeForInstrumentStream } from "./glue";

function StockDetails() {
    const stockData = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem("stock")) || {};
    const { RIC, BPOD, Bloomberg, Description, Exchange, Venues } = stockData;
    const [{ Bid, Ask }, setPrices] = useState({ Bid: stockData.Bid, Ask: stockData.Ask});

    useGlue(subscribeForInstrumentStream(setPrices), [RIC]);    
    ...
};
```

You can now observe that **Stock Details** also displays a new value for the `Bid` and `Ask` prices at regular intervals.

## 4. Window Management

Now, you will extend the **Stocks** and **Stock Details** apps with new functionalities using the [**Window Management API**](../../../reference/core/latest/windows/index.html). When the user clicks on a stock in the **Stocks** app, the **Stock Details** app will open in a new window with specific dimensions. Also, the selected stock will be passed from from the **Stocks** app to the **Stock Details** app using the window context.

### 4.1. Opening Windows at Runtime

First, go to the `glue.js` file of the **Stocks** app and define a function that will open the **Stock Details** app in a new window. Use the `glue.windows.open()` method and pass a name and a URL for the new window. The name must be unique.

```javascript
let windowId = 0;

export const openStockDetails = (glue) => (symbol) => {
    const name = `StockDetailsReact${++windowId}`;
    const URL = `http://${window.location.host}/details`;

    // Opening a new window by providing a name and a URL.
    glue.windows.open(name, URL);
};
```

### 4.2. Window Settings

Next, pass an object with settings for the new window as a third parameter. Define the position (`top`, `left`) and the size (`width`, `height`) of the new window:

```javascript
export const openStockDetails = (glue) => (symbol) => {
    const name = `StockDetailsReact${++windowId}`;
    const URL = `http://${window.location.host}/details`;

    // Optional object with settings for the new window.
    const windowSettings = {
        top: 100,
        left: 100,
        width: 660,
        height: 660
    };

    glue.windows.open(name, URL, windowSettings);
};
```

### 4.3. Window Context

Every Glue42 Window has its own `context` property (its value can be any object) which can be defined when opening the window and can be updated later. You will pass the stock selected from the **Stocks** app as a window context for the new **Stock Details** window:

```javascript
export const openStockDetails = (glue) => (symbol) => {
    const name = `StockDetailsReact${++windowId}`;
    const URL = `http://${window.location.host}/details`;
    const windowSettings = {
        top: 100,
        left: 100,
        width: 660,
        height: 660,
        // Pass the `symbol` as a context for the new window.
        context: { symbol }
    };

    glue.windows.open(name, URL, windowSettings);
};
```

Next, you also have to define a function that will get the **Stock Details** app will use to get the context:

```javascript
export const getMyWindowContext = glue => glue.windows.my().context;
```

Now, go to the **Stocks** app and comment out or delete the existing handler for showing stock details. Consume the `openStockDetails()` function with the help of the `useGlue()` hook:

```javascript
import { openStockDetails } from "./glue";

function Stocks() {
    const onClick = useGlue(openStockDetails);
};
```

In the `return` statement, update the event handler for each instrument row in the stocks table by replacing the existing `onClick` property:

```javascript
<tbody>
    {portfolio.map(({ RIC, Description, Bid, Ask, ...rest }) => (
        <tr onClick={() => onClick({ ...rest, RIC, Description })} key={RIC}>
            <td>{RIC}</td>
            <td>{Description}</td>
            <td className="text-right">{Bid}</td>
            <td className="text-right">{Ask}</td>
        </tr>
    ))}
</tbody>
```

Finally, go to the **Stock Details** app to get the window context. Comment out or remove the existing code for getting the stock from the `sessionStorage`. Define the `glue` object using the `GlueContext` and pass the `getMyWindowContext()` function to the `useGlue()` hook to get the window context:

```javascript
import { getMyWindowContext } from "./glue";

function StockDetails() {
    const glue = useContext(GlueContext);
    // Get the window context.
    const windowContext = useGlue(getMyWindowContext);
    // Extract the selected stock from the window context.
    const {
        symbol: { RIC, BPOD, Bloomberg, Description, Exchange, Venues, Bid, Ask } = {}
    } = windowContext || {};
};
```

Now, when you click on a stock in the **Stocks** app, the **Stock Details** app will open in a new window displaying information about the selected stock.

## 5. Shared Contexts

This section will show you how to update context objects and subscribe for context updates using the [**Shared Contexts API**](../../../reference/core/latest/shared%20contexts/index.html). You will extend the **Clients** app to update a context with information about the selected client, instead of using the Interop API to invoke a method. The **Stocks** app, instead of registering an Interop method, will subscribe for updates to the same context object to display the relevant client portfolio. You will add a "Show All" button to the **Stocks** app that will clear the context value in order to show information about all stocks. The **Stock Details** app will also subscribe for updates to this context in order to show whether the selected client has the selected stock in their portfolio.

### 5.1. Updating a Context

First, go to the `glue.js` file of the **Clients** and **Stocks** apps and define a function for updating the shared context object:

```javascript
import { SHARED_CONTEXT_NAME } from "./constants";

export const setClientPortfolioSharedContext = (glue) => (
    {
        clientId = "",
        clientName = "",
        portfolio = ""
    }
) => {
    glue.contexts.update(SHARED_CONTEXT_NAME, {
        clientId,
        clientName,
        portfolio
    });
};
```

Go to the **Clients** app and replace the `setClientPortfolioInterop()` handler for selecting a client with the `setClientPortfolioSharedContext()` one. Pass `portfolio` to `onClick` when calling it.

```javascript
import { setClientPortfolioSharedContext } from "./glue";

function Clients() {
    const onClick = useGlue(setClientPortfolioSharedContext);

    ...

    return (
        ...
        {clients.map(({ name, pId, gId, accountManager, portfolio }) => (
            <tr
                key={pId}
                onClick={() => onClick({ clientId: gId, clientName: name, portfolio })}
            >
            ...
        ))}
        ...
    );
  }
```

Go to the **Stocks** app and define a handler for updating the shared context with the `useGlue()` hook. Also, add a "Show All" button in the `return` statement of the component that will invoke the handler on button click:

```javascript
import { setClientPortfolioSharedContext } from "./glue";

function Stocks() {
    ...
    const updateClientContext = useGlue(setClientPortfolioSharedContext);
    ...
    return (
        <div className="container-fluid">
        ...
            <button
                type="button"
                className="mb-3 btn btn-primary"
                onClick={() => updateClientContext({})}
            >
                Show All
            </button>
        ...
        </div>
    );
};
```

### 5.2. Subscribing for Context Updates

You have to subscribe the **Stocks** and **Stock Details** apps for updates to the same context object in order to update them accordingly when the user selects a new client.

First, go to the `glue.js` file of the **Stocks** app and define a function for subscribing to the context. Use the `glue.contexts.subscribe()` method:

```javascript
export const subscribeForSharedContext = (handler) => (glue) => {
    // Subscribing for the shared context by 
    // providing a context name and a handler for context updates.
    glue.contexts.subscribe(SHARED_CONTEXT_NAME, handler);
};
```

Go to the `Stocks.jsx` component and replace the `registerSetClientMethod()` handler with the `subscribeForSharedContext()` one:

```javascript
import { subscribeForSharedContext } from "./glue";

function Stocks() {
    ...
    useGlue(subscribeForSharedContext(setClient));
    ...
};
```

Finally, go to the `StockDetails.jsx` component and also subscribe for updates to the shared context. Add an element in the `return` statement that will display conditionally depending on whether the client has the selected stock in their portfolio. You will need to add the client information (`clientId`, `clientName`, `portfolio`) to the component state to be able to display data about the currently selected client and use the `portfolio` to determine whether the client has the selected stock in their portfolio. 

```javascript
import { subscribeForSharedContext } from "./glue";

function StockDetails() {
    ...
    const [{ clientId, clientName, portfolio }, setClient] = useState({});
    ...
    useGlue(subscribeForSharedContext(setClient));

    return (
        <div className="container-fluid">
        ...
            <div className="row">
                {clientId && (
                <>
                    <h2 className="p-3">
                    Client {clientName} - {clientId}{" "}
                    </h2>
                    {RIC && portfolio.length && !portfolio.includes(RIC) && (
                        <h4 className="p-3">
                            The client does not have this stock in their portfolio.
                        </h4>
                    )}
                </>
                )}
            ...
            </div>
        ...
        </div>
    );
};
```

## 6. Channels

Currently, no matter how many instances of the **Stocks** app are running, they are all listening for updates to the same context and therefore all show information about the same selected client. Here, you will use the [Channels API](../../../reference/core/latest/channels/index.html) to allow each instance of the **Stocks** app to subscribe for updates to the context of a selected channel. The different channels are color coded and the user will be able to select a channel from a Channel Selector UI. The **Clients** app will update the context of the currently selected channel when the user clicks on a client.

### 6.1. Channels Configuration

First, you need to add channel definitions to the [Glue42 Environment](../../../core/core-concepts/environment/overview/index.html). Add the following configuration to the `glue.config.json` file located at the base directory of your project. After that, restart the Glue42 CLI by quitting it and running the `gluec serve` command again for the changes to take effect:

```json
{
    "glue": ...,
    "gateway": ...,
    "channels": [
        {
            "name": "Red",
            "meta": {
                "color": "red"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Green",
            "meta": {
                "color": "green"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Blue",
            "meta": {
                "color": "#66ABFF"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Pink",
            "meta": {
                "color": "#F328BB"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Yellow",
            "meta": {
                "color": "#FFE733"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Dark Yellow",
            "meta": {
                "color": "#b09b00"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Orange",
            "meta": {
                "color": "#fa5a28"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Purple",
            "meta": {
                "color": "#c873ff"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Lime",
            "meta": {
                "color": "#8af59e"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Cyan",
            "meta": {
                "color": "#80f3ff"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

To enable the Channels API, you need to pass a configuration object to the `GlueProvider` component:

```javascript
// Enabling the Channels API.
<GlueProvider config={{ channels: true }} glueFactory={GlueWeb}>
    ...
</GlueProvider>
```

The `GlueProvider` will initialize internally the [**Glue42 Web**](../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library and enable the Channels API.

### 6.2. Channel Selector Widget

The users have to be able to navigate through the channels for which they will need some sort of user interface. You can create your own channel selector widget by using the Channels API, but for the purpose of the tutorial there is a `ChannelSelectorWidget` component provided. To add it to the **Stocks** and **Clients** apps, follow these steps:

1. Import the Channel Selector widget in the `Clients.jsx` and `Stocks.jsx` components:

```javascript
import ChannelSelectorWidget from "./ChannelSelectorWidget";
```

2. To use the use the new component, you have to pass two props to it:
- `channelNamesAndColors` - the names and colors of all available channels; 
- `onChannelSelected` - handler that will be called when the channel changes; 

Go to the `glue.js` file of the **Clients** and **Stocks** apps and define the following functions:

```javascript
// This will be used to signify that the app is not connected to any channel.
import { NO_CHANNEL_VALUE } from "./constants";

// Returns all names and color codes of the avaialbale channels.
export const getChannelNamesAndColors = async (glue) => {
    // Getting a list of all channel contexts.
    const channelContexts = await glue.channels.list();

    // Extracting only the names and colors of the channels.
    const channelNamesAndColors = channelContexts.map((channelContext) => {
        const channelInfo = {
            name: channelContext.name,
            color: channelContext.meta.color
        };

        return channelInfo;
    });

    return channelNamesAndColors;
};

// This function will join a given channel.
export const joinChannel = (glue) => ({ value: channelName }) => {
    if (channelName === NO_CHANNEL_VALUE) {
        // Checking for the current channel.
        if (glue.channels.my()) {
            // Leaving a channel.
            glue.channels.leave();
        }
    } else {
        // Joining a channel.
        glue.channels.join(channelName);
    };
};
```

3. Now you need to setup the `ChannelSelectorWidget` in both apps. 

Go to the **Clients** app to set up the channels functionalities.

```javascript
import {
    getChannelNamesAndColors,
    joinChannel
} from "./glue";

function Clients() {
    ...
    const channelNamesAndColors = useGlue(getChannelNamesAndColors);
    const onChannelSelected = useGlue(joinChannel);
    ...
};
```

You can now create the `ChannelWidgetSelector` component in the `return` statement. Pass the `channelNamesAndColors` and `onChannelSelected` as props to it:

```javascript
return (
    <div className="container-fluid">
        <div className="row">
            ...
            <div className="col-md-10">
                <h1 className="text-center">Clients</h1>
            </div>
            <div className="col-md-2 align-self-center">
                <ChannelSelectorWidget
                    channelNamesAndColors={channelNamesAndColors}
                    onChannelSelected={onChannelSelected}
                />
            </div>
            ...
        </div>
        ...
    </div>
);
```

4. Go to the **Stocks** app to set up the channels functionalities. Create a `setDefaultClient()` callback for handling the default state where no client has been selected.

```javascript
import {
    getChannelNamesAndColors,
    joinChannel
} from "./glue";

function Stocks() {
    ...
    const channelNamesAndColors = useGlue(getChannelNamesAndColors);
    const onChannelSelected = useGlue(joinChannel);
    const setDefaultClient = () => setClient({ clientId: "", clientName: "" });
    ...
};
```

You can now create the `ChannelWidgetSelector` component in the `return` statement. Pass the `channelNamesAndColors` and `onChannelSelected` as props to it: 

```javascript
return (
    <div className="container-fluid">
        <div className="row">
            ...
            <div className="col-md-10">
                <h1 className="text-center">Clients</h1>
            </div>
            <div className="col-md-2 align-self-center">
                <ChannelSelectorWidget
                    channelNamesAndColors={channelNamesAndColors}
                    onChannelSelected={onChannelSelected}
                    onDefaultChannelSelected={setDefaultClient}
                />
            </div>
            ...
        </div>
        ...
    </div>
);
```

Finally, add a `key` prop to the `ChannelSelectorWidget` component. It will hold the value of the `channelWidgetState` state variable which will be used to clear the state of the `ChannelSelectorWidget` when the user clicks the "Show All" button to clear the currently selected client. Update the code of the `onClick` handler in the button:

```javascript
function Stocks() {
    ...
    const [channelWidgetState, setChannelWidgetState] = useState(false);
    ...

    return (
        ...
        <button
            type="button"
            className="mb-3 btn btn-primary"
            onClick={() => {
                setChannelWidgetState(!channelWidgetState);
                setDefaultClient();
            }}
        >
            Show All
        </button>
        ...
    );
};
```

### 6.3. Publishing and Subscribing

Next, you need to enable the **Clients** app to publish updates to the current channel context and the **Stocks** app to subscribe for these updates.

Go to the `glue.js` file of the **Clients** app and define a function that will publish updates to the current channel: 

```javascript
export const setClientPortfolioChannels = (glue) => (
    {
        clientId = "",
        clientName = ""
    }
) => {
    // Checking for the current channel.
    if (glue.channels.my()) {
        // Publishing data to the channel.
        glue.channels.publish({ clientId, clientName });
    };
};
```

Go the `Clients.jsx` component to use this function to update the current channel.

*Note: Do not comment out `setClientPortfolioSharedContext()` code. The **Stock Details** app still uses the shared context to get the client information. Just rename the variable holding the click handler from `onClick` to `onClickContext` and use both handlers.*

```javascript
import { setClientPortfolioChannels } from "./glue";

function Clients() {
    ...
    // This is renamed from `onClick` to `onClickContext`.
    const onClickContext = useGlue(setClientPortfolioSharedContext);
    const onClick = useGlue(setClientPortfolioChannels);
    ...

    return (
        ...
        <tr
            key={pId}
            onClick={() => {
                    // Use both handlers.
                    onClickContext({ clientId: gId, clientName: name, portfolio })
                    onClick({ clientId: gId, clientName: name })
                }
            }
        >
        ...
    );
};
```

Next, go to the `glue.js` file of the **Stocks** app and define a function that will subscribe for channel updates:

```javascript
export const subscribeForChannels = (handler) => (glue) => {
    // Subscribing for updates to the current channel.
    glue.channels.subscribe(handler);
};
```

Go to the `Stocks.jsx` component and comment out or delete the code that uses the Shared Contexts API to listen for updates to the shared context. Instead, subscribe for channel updates:

```javascript
import { subscribeForChannels } from "./glue";

function Stocks() {
    ...
    useGlue(subscribeForChannels(setClient));
    ...
};
```

Now, you can open multiple instances of the **Stocks** app and keep them on different colored channels. The **Clients** app will update only the context of the channel it is currently on and only the instance of the **Stocks** app that is on the same channel will update accordingly.

## 7. Application Management

Up until now the **Stocks** app had to use the Window Management API to open the **Stock Details** application when the user clicks on a stock. This works fine for small projects, but does not scale well for larger ones, because this way each app has to know all details (URL, start position, initial context, etc.) about every application it needs to start. In this chapter you will replace the Window Management API with the [Application Management API](../../../reference/core/latest/appmanager/index.html) which will allow you to predefine the applications in the [Glue42 Environment](../../../core/core-concepts/environment/overview/index.html). The **Stocks** app will be decoupled from the **Stock Details** - it will need only the name of the **Stock Details** app to be able to start it.

### 7.1. Application Configuration

To take advantage of the [Application Management API](../../../reference/core/latest/appmanager/index.html), you need to define configurations for your applications in the `glue.config.json` file of your project and enable the Application Management API by passing a [`Config`](../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html#!Config) object during the initialization of the [Glue42 Web](../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library in each application.

First, open the `glue.config.json` and add the following application configurations using the `appManager` top-level key. Restart the Glue42 CLI by quitting it and running the `gluec serve` command again for the changes to take effect:

```json
{
    "glue": ...,
    "gateway": ...,
    "channels": ...,
    "appManager": {
        "localApplications": [
            {
                "name": "Clients",
                "details": {
                    "url": "http://localhost:4242/clients"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Stocks",
                "details": {
                    "url": "http://localhost:4242/stocks",
                    "left": 0,
                    "top": 0,
                    "width": 860,
                    "height": 600
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Stock Details",
                "details": {
                    "url": "http://localhost:4242/details",
                    "left": 100,
                    "top": 100,
                    "width": 400,
                    "height": 400
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Split the Stocks App

Make **Stock Details** a standalone app so that it will be available as a separate Glue42 application through the [Application Management API](../../../reference/core/latest/appmanager/index.html):

- Create a new React app named `stock-details` in the root directory of your **Glue42 Core** project following the instructions in [Chapter 1.5.](#1_setup-15_react_project_setup).

- Go to the **Stocks** app and copy the `glue.js` and `constants.js` files to the newly created **Stock Details** app - in the `/stock-details/src` directory, to reuse the existing Glue42 functionalities.

Next, update the code of the **Stocks** app. Go to the `index.js` file of the **Stocks** app and comment out or delete the `StockDetails` import and the code checking for the browser URL, because the **Stock Details** app is no longer part of the **Stocks** app. Change the `<App />` component to `<Stocks />`.

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
    <GlueProvider config={{ channels: true }} glueFactory={GlueWeb}>
        <Stocks />
    </GlueProvider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Remember to restart the Glue42 CLI by quitting it and running the `gluec serve` command again for the changes to take effect.

#### Enable the Application Management API

Glue42 enable the newly created **Stock Details** app and enable the Application Management API by passing `appManager: true` and the name of the application (as defined in the `glue.config.json` file) in the configuration object for the Glue42 library. Also, add all imports from the example below, remove the `App` import and replace the `<App />` component with `<StockDetails />`:

```javascript
import GlueWeb from "@glue42/web";
import { GlueProvider } from "@glue42/react-hooks";
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
import StockDetails from "./StockDetails";

ReactDOM.render(
    <GlueProvider config={{ channels: true, appManager: true, application: "Stock Details" }} glueFactory={GlueWeb}>
        <StockDetails />
    </GlueProvider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

To enable the Application Management API in the **Clients** and the **Stocks** apps, go to their `index.js` files and pass `appManager: true` and the respective application name to the `config` property of the `<GlueProvider />` component:

```javascript
// Enabling the Application Management API in the Stocks app.
ReactDOM.render(
    <GlueProvider config={{ channels: true, appManager: true, application: "Stocks" }} glueFactory={GlueWeb}>
        <Stocks />
    </GlueProvider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

The application name is used by the platform to map it to the respective local/remote application definition that is then accessible through the `application` property of [`glue.appManager.myInstance`](../../../reference/core/latest/appmanager/index.html#!API-myInstance). For the mapping to work, it is important that the application name provided when initializing the Glue42 Web library is the same as the application name defined in the local/remote application configuration.

### 7.2. Starting Applications

Go to the `glue.js` file of the **Stock** app and edit the `openStockDetails()` function. Use the [`glue.appManager.application()`](../../../reference/core/latest/appmanager/index.html#!API-application) method to get the **Stock Details** app and call the `start()` method on the application object to start it. The `start()` method also accepts a context object as a first parameter that will be passed as context to the started application instance:

```javascript
export const openStockDetails = glue => symbol => {
    glue.appManager.application("Stock Details").start({ symbol });
}
```

Go to the `glue.js` files of the **Stocks** and the **Stock Details** apps and edit the `getMyWindowContext()` function to get the window context using the Application Management API:

```javascript
export const getMyWindowContext = glue => glue.appManager.myInstance.context;
```

Everything should work as before, the difference being that now the apps are using the Application Management API instead of the Window Management API.

### 7.3. Application Instances

Next, you will use the Application Management API to add new functionality to the **Clients** application. When the user selects a client, you can check whether there is a running instance of the **Stocks** app, and if there isn't one, you will start the **Stocks** app. You will also pass the current channel as context to the started instance of the **Stocks** app. Each application object has an `instances` property that allows you to get the running instances of the application.

Go to the `glue.js` file of the **Clients** app and pass the current channel as context:

```javascript
export const startApp = glue => () => {
    const isStocksRunning = glue.appManager.application("Stocks").instances.length > 0;
    if (!isStocksRunning) {
        glue.channels.list().then(channels => {
            let channel = {};
            if (glue.channels.my()) {
                const channelDefinition = channels.find(channel => channel.name === glue.channels.my());
                channel = {
                    name: channelDefinition.name,
                    label: channelDefinition.name,
                    color: channelDefinition.meta.color
                };
            } else {
                channel = {
                    name: NO_CHANNEL_VALUE,
                    label: NO_CHANNEL_VALUE
                }
            }
            glue.appManager.application("Stocks").start({ channel });
        });
    }
}
```

*Note that the `ChannelSelectorWidget` wraps a React `Select` component and to use it as a controlled component (when you want to make the **Stocks** app automatically select a channel on startup), you must create a proper channel definition object using the values of the `name` and `meta.color` properties and pass it to the **Stocks** application.*

Import the `startApp()` function in the `Clients.jsx`, create a `startStocksApp()` callback and pass it to the `onClick` handler of the client row:

```javascript
import { startApp } from "./glue.js";

function Clients() {
    ...
    const startStocksApp = useGlue(startApp);
    ...

    return (
        ...
        <tbody>
            {clients.map(({ name, pId, gId, accountManager, portfolio }) => (
                <tr
                    key={pId}
                    onClick={() => {
                            onClickContext({ clientId: gId, clientName: name, portfolio })
                            onClick({ clientId: gId, clientName: name, portfolio })
                            startStocksApp();
                        }
                    }
                >
                    <td>{name}</td>
                    <td>{pId}</td>
                    <td>{gId}</td>
                    <td>{accountManager}</td>
                </tr>
            ))}
        </tbody>
        ...
    )
}
```

Go to the **Stocks** app and use the `getWindowContext()` function from the `glue.js` file to get the channel passed as window context by the **Clients** application. Import the `NO_CHANNEL_VALUE` constant from `constants.js` to handle the case when no channel is available in the window context:

```javascript
import { getMyWindowContext } from "./glue";
import { NO_CHANNEL_VALUE } from "./constants";

function Stocks() {
    ...
    const windowContext = useGlue(getMyWindowContext) || {};

    useEffect(() => {
        if (windowContext.channel) {
            setCurrentChannel(windowContext.channel);
            if (onChannelSelected) {
                onChannelSelected({ value: windowContext.channel.name });
            }
        } else {
            setCurrentChannel({ value: NO_CHANNEL_VALUE, label: NO_CHANNEL_VALUE });
        }
    }, [windowContext.channel, onChannelSelected]);
    ...
}
```

Add a `value` property to the `<ChannelSelectorWidget />` that will hold the `currentChannel` value. Add the `setCurentChannel()` function to the `onChannelSelected` property:

```javascript
function Stocks() {
    ...
    return (
        ...
        <div className="col-md-2 align-self-center">
            <ChannelSelectorWidget
                value={currentChannel}
                key={channelWidgetState}
                channelNamesAndColors={channelNamesAndColors}
                onChannelSelected={channel => {
                    onChannelSelected(channel);
                    setCurrentChannel(channel);
                }}
                onDefaultChannelSelected={channel => {
                    setDefaultClient();
                    onChannelSelected(channel);
                    setCurrentChannel({ value: NO_CHANNEL_VALUE, label: NO_CHANNEL_VALUE });
                }}
            />
        </div>
        ...
    )
}
```

The `onChannelSelected()` function manages the channel selection and the `setCurrentChannel()` function visualizes the current channel in the component.

## 8. Workspaces

The latest feedback from the users is that their desktops very quickly become cluttered with multiple floating windows. The Glue42 Core Workspaces feature solves exactly that problem.

The new requirement is that when a user clicks on a client in the Clients application, a new Workspace should open displaying detailed information about the selected client in one app and his stocks portfolio in another. When the user clicks on a stock, a third application should appear in the same Workspace displaying more details about the selected stock. You will use the Client Details application for displaying information about the selected client.

Go to the `Stocks/src/index.js`and ``Clients/src/index.js`` files of the Clients and Stocks apps and comment out all logic and references related to Channels, introduced in a previous chapter. Instead, you will use Workspaces to allow the users to work with multiple clients at once and organize their desktop at the same time. Channels and Workspaces can, of course, be used together to provide extremely enhanced user experience, but in order to focus entirely on working with Workspaces, the Channels functionality will be ignored.

Use the [Workspaces API](../../../reference/core/latest/workspaces/index.html) documentation as a reference when working on this chapter.

## 8.1. Setup

Configure your current development environment for Workspaces by running the following command in the Glue42 CLI, in the Glue42 root `start` directory of all your projects:

```cmd
gluec workspaces init
```

This command will add the necessary Workspaces packages to your project and set up the Workspaces default settings in your configuration files.

**Note** that this command only works if the current directory has already been initialized with the gluec init command. In case of a brand new Glue42 Core project, you have to use the `gluec init -w` command to set up the basic Glue42 Core files and Workspaces at the same time.

## 8.1.1. Creating the Client Details application

We will create a new react application which will display the information of a single client. Go to the root `start` directory and run the following command:

```cmd
npx create-react-app client-details
```

Create a `.env` file in the `client-details` folder containing the following:

```cmd
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
PORT=3003
```

Go to the `package.json` file of the `client-details` project and paste the following line below the `eslintConfig` property:

```json
  "homepage": "/client-details/",
```

Install the following dependencies inside the `clients-details` project:

```cmd
npm i --save @glue42/react-hooks@1.0.7 react-select@3.1.0 bootstrap@4.4.1 react-app-rewired@2.1.5 chroma-js@2.1.0
```

Go inside the `package.json` file and change the `start`, `build`, and `test` scripts to the following:

```json
"start": "react-app-rewired start --scripts-version react-scripts",
"build": "react-app-rewired build --scripts-version react-scripts",
"test": "react-app-rewired test --scripts-version react-scripts",
```

Copy the file `Stocks/config-overrides.js` from the root directory of the `Stocks` project into the root directory of `client-details`.

Now we need to create the `ClientDetails.jsx` file. Go inside `client-details/src` and create a new file named `ClientDetails.jsx` and paste the following code:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ClientDetails() {
    const [client, setClient] = useState({});
    return (
        <div className="container-fluid">
            <div className="row">
                <div className="col-md-2">
                    <span id="glueSpan" className="label label-warning">Glue42 is unavailable</span>
                </div>
                <div className="col-md-10">
                    <h1 className="text-center">Client Details</h1>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div className="row">
                <div className="col-md-12">
                    <h3 id="clientStatus"></h3>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div className="row">
                <table id="clientsTable" className="table table-hover">
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Full Name</th>
                            <td data-name>{client && client.clientName}</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Address</th>
                            <td data-address>{client && client.address}</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Phone Number</th>
                            <td data-phone>{client && client.contactNumbers}</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Email</th>
                            <td data-email>{client && client.email}</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Account Manager</th>
                            <td data-manager>{client && client.accountManager}</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}

export default ClientDetails;
```

Open the file `client-details/src/index.js` and delete the `App` import and the `<App/>` component and add the following code in addition to the code that is already there. Add the settings `appManager:ture` and `application: 'Client Details`, because we want to use the application with the Application Management API:

```javascript
import GlueWeb from "@glue42/web";
import { GlueProvider } from '@glue42/react-hooks';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
import ClientDetails from './ClientDetails';

ReactDOM.render(
    <GlueProvider config={{ channels: true, appManager: true, application: 'Client Details' }} glueFactory={GlueWeb}>
        <ClientDetails />
    </GlueProvider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

We have to tell `gluec` that we have created a new application and that we would like to use it. Go to `glue.config.dev.json` inside the root `start` directory and add the folowing lines under the `server.app` array:

```json
{
    "route": "/client-details",
    "localhost": {
        "port": 3003
    }
}
```

We have to register the application with the **Application Management API**. Open the `glue.config.json` and add the following configurations in the `"localApplications"` array under the `"appManager"` property:

```javascript
{
    "name": "Client Details",
    "details": {
        "url": "http://localhost:4242/client-details"
    }
}
```

Restart `gluec` and go to the `http://localhost:4242/client-details` route to check if everything is setup correctly. 

**Note**: If you get a blank screen or an error in the console, try going over the steps again or see the file in the `solution` directory.

## 8.2. Workspace Layouts

Next, you need to build a Workspace layout which will be the blueprint of the Workspace that the Clients app will restore when the user clicks on a client. This layout should contain the Client Details and Stocks apps.

**Note**: you have to define all apps that will be used in the Workspace in the glue.config.json file. Also, you have to specify the application name in the applications property of the configuration object when initializing them as Glue42 Clients. This is necessary in order for the applications to become available in the "Add Application" menu of the Workspaces App. If you have followed the tutorial thus far, you have already configured everything. Run the following command in the root `start` directory:

```cmd
gluec workspaces build
```

**Note**: in order for this command to work, the Glue42 development server **must** be running.

This will open the Workspace Builder in your default browser. Add the `ClientDetails` app by clicking on the + icon in the center and then add the `Stocks` app by clicking the + icon in the top right corner of the newly formed group. You should have both apps open next to each other in the new Workspace.

Save the Workspace layout by clicking the "Save" icon on the left of the Workspace title and name it (e.g., "example"). Next, click the "Download" button and save the .txt file in the project directory. Copy the contents of the downloaded .txt file and paste it in the workspaces array of the glue.layouts.json file.

Now this Workspace layout can be restored by name using the [Workspaces API](../../../reference/core/latest/workspaces/index.html).

## 8.3. Initializing Workspaces
To be able to use Workspaces functionalities, you need to initialize the [Workspaces API](../../../reference/core/latest/workspaces/index.html) in the Clients, Client Details and Stocks apps. The Stock Details app will participate in the Workspace, but will not need to use any Workspaces functionality. Go inside `Clients`, `Stocks`, `Stock Details`, and `Client Details` application folders and run the following command inside each one of them:

```cmd
npm i --save @glue42/workspaces-api
```

Next, go inside the `index.js` file of each application and import the `GlueWorkspaces` library and pass it to the config property of the `<GlueProvider/>` component:

```javascript
// Clients/src/index.js
import GlueWorkspaces from '@glue42/workspaces-api';

ReactDOM.render(
    <GlueProvider config={{ channels: true, appManager: true, application: 'Clients', libraries: [GlueWorkspaces] }} glueFactory={GlueWeb}>
        <Clients />
    </GlueProvider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

```javascript
// Stocks/src/index.js
import GlueWorkspaces from '@glue42/workspaces-api';

ReactDOM.render(
    <GlueProvider config={{ channels: true, appManager: true, application: 'Stocks', libraries: [GlueWorkspaces] }} glueFactory={GlueWeb}>
        <Stocks />
    </GlueProvider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

```javascript
// StockDetails/src/index.js
import GlueWorkspaces from '@glue42/workspaces-api';

ReactDOM.render(
    <GlueProvider config={{ channels: true, appManager: true, application: 'Stock Details', libraries: [GlueWorkspaces] }} glueFactory={GlueWeb}>
        <StockDetails />
    </GlueProvider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

```javascript
// ClientDetails/src/index.js
import GlueWorkspaces from '@glue42/workspaces-api';

ReactDOM.render(
    <GlueProvider config={{ channels: true, appManager: true, application: 'Client Details', libraries: [GlueWorkspaces] }} glueFactory={GlueWeb}>
        <ClientDetails />
    </GlueProvider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## 8.4. Opening Workspaces

Next, you have to implement opening a new Workspace when the user clicks on a client in the Clients app. Go to the clientClickedHandler function in the Clients app, restore by name the Workspace layout you created earlier and pass the selected client as a starting context. The specified context will be attached as a window context to all windows participating in the Workspace. 

Go inside the `glue.js` file in `Clients/src` and add the following code:

```javascript
export const startAppWithWorkspace = glue => client => {
    glue.workspaces.restoreWorkspace("example", { context: client });
}
```

Import the function in `Clients.jsx` and create a new callback to be passed to the onClick handler of the `<tr>` element:

```javascript
import { startAppWithWorkspace } from './glue';

function Clients() {
    // ...
    const openWorkspace = useGlue(startAppWithWorkspace);
    // ...
}
```

Delete all the code from the onClick handler of the `<tr>` element and replace it with the following code:

```javascript
<tbody>
    {clients.map(({ name, pId, gId, accountManager, portfolio, ...rest }) => (
        <tr
            key={pId}
            onClick={() => {
                    openWorkspace({ clientId: gId, clientName: name, accountManager, portfolio, ...rest });

        </tr>
    ))}
</tbody>
```
If everything is correct, a new Workspace should now open every time you click a client.

## 8.5. Starting Context

The windows of the Client Details and Stocks apps participating in the new Workspace will have a starting context attached to them. You have to handle this starting context in order to display the relevant client data when the user selects a client from the Clients app.

To get the starting window context, you have to subscribe for updates to the context of the current window using the Window Management API. When the window context has been updated and if it contains a client property, you have to handle the client data in the respective application and also set the Workspace title to the name of the selected client.

Create a new file named `glue.js` inside `client-details/src` and add the following code to it:

```javascript
// client-details/src/glue.js
export const setClientFromWorkspace = setClient => glue => {
    glue.windows.my().onContextUpdated(context => {
        if (context) {
            setClient(context);
        }
    });
}
```

Import the function in `ClientDetails.jsx` and set it up using the `useGlue` react hook:

```javascript
import { getClient } from './glue';

function ClientDetails() {
    // ...
    useGlue(getClient(setClient));
    // ...
}
```

Next, we need to update the `Stocks.jsx` application to show the stocks of the currently selected client, the one that is being displayed inside the `client-details` application. Go inside the `glue.js` file in `Stocks/src` folder and add the following code at the end of the file:

```javascript
// Stocks/src/glue.js
export const setClientFromWorkspace = setClient => glue => {
    glue.windows.my().onContextUpdated(context => {
        if (context) {
            setClient({ clientId: context.clientId, clientName: context.clientName });
        }
    });
}
```

Import the function in `Stocks.jsx` and set it up using the `useGlue` react hook:

```javascript
import { setClientFromWorkspace } from './glue';

function Stocks() {
    // ...
    useGlue(setClientFromWorkspace(setClient));
    // ...
}
```

Now when you select a client in the Clients app, a new Workspace should open with the Client Details and Stocks apps showing the relevant client information.

## 8.6. Modifying Workspaces

Next, you have to make the Stock Details app appear in the same Workspace as a sibling of the Stocks app when the user clicks on a stock. You have to check whether the Stock Details app has already been added to the Workspace, and if not - add it and update its context with the selected stock, otherwise - only update its context.

To achieve this functionality, you will have to manipulate a Workspace and its elements. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the Workspaces terminology to fully understand the concepts and steps below. You can use the available documentation about Workspaces Concepts, Workspace Box Elements and the Workspaces API.

The Stocks app is a WorkspaceWindow that is the only child of a Group element. If you add the Stock Details app as a child to that Group, it will be added as a second tab window and the user will have to manually switch between both apps. The Stock Details has to be a sibling of the Stocks app, but both apps have to be visible within the same parent element. That is why, you have to add a new Group element as a sibling of the existing Group that contains the Stocks app, and then load the Stock Details app in it.

After the Stocks Details app has been opened in the Workspace as a WorkspaceWindow, you have to pass the selected stock as its context. To do that, get a reference to the underlying Glue42 Window object of the Stock Details window using the getGdWindow() method of the WorkspaceWindow instance and update its context with the updateContext() method.

Firstly, go inside the `glue.js` in `Stocks/src` and create the following function:

```javascript
// Stocks/src/glue.js
export const openStockDetailsInWorkspace = glue => async stock => {
    let detailsGlue42Window;
    const myWorkspace = await glue.workspaces.getMyWorkspace();
    let detailsWorkspaceWindow = myWorkspace.getWindow(window => window.appName === 'Stock Details');
    if (detailsWorkspaceWindow) {
        detailsGlue42Window = detailsWorkspaceWindow.getGdWindow();
    } else {
        const myId = glue.windows.my().id;
        const myImmediateParent = myWorkspace.getWindow(window => window.id === myId).parent;
        const group = await myImmediateParent.parent.addGroup();
        detailsWorkspaceWindow = await group.addWindow({ appName: 'Stock Details' });
        await detailsWorkspaceWindow.forceLoad();
        detailsGlue42Window = detailsWorkspaceWindow.getGdWindow();
    }
    detailsGlue42Window.updateContext({ stock });
}
```

Import the function in `Stocks.jsx`, comment out the `onClick` callback created by using the funcion `openStockDetails` and repalce it with the newly created `openStockDetailsInWorkspace` function:

```javascript
import { openStockDetailsInWorkspace } from './glue';

function Stocks() {
    // ...
    // const onClick = useGlue(openStockDetails);
    const onClick = useGlue(openStockDetailsInWorkspace);
    // ...
}
```

We can now open the `Stock Details` application using the Workspaces API, but the stock details are not being displayed right now, because we need to use the API in the `Stock Details` application to get the information about the stock.

Go inside the `glue.js` file in `stock-details/src/` folder and change the `getMyWindowContext` to the following:

```javascript
// stock-details/src/glue.js
export const getMyWindowContext = setWindowContext => glue => {
    glue.windows.my().onContextUpdated(context => {
        if (context.stock) {
            setWindowContext({ symbol: context.stock });
        }
    })
}
```

Import the function in the file `StockDetails.jsx` and extract the `windowContext` variable to a react hooks state variable. We will track the changes to the `windowContext` variable using the `onContextUpdated` method, instead of getting it one time from the context:

```javascript
import { getMyWindowContext } from './glue';

function StockDetails() {
    // ...
    const [windowContext, setWindowContext] = useState({});
    // const windowContext = useGlue(getMyWindowContext) || {};
    useGlue(getMyWindowContext(setWindowContext));
    // ...
}

```

## 9. Deployment

With the fully developed app, it is time to deploy it to an environment. We will give examples of how to do deploy and app created using `create-react-app`, using `webpack`.

### 9.1. Deploying using webpack. Ejecting application from create-react-app

If you are using a scaffolding tool to build your react enabled applications, you will need to perfom aditional steps to reach the `webpack.config.js` file. There are to ways to go about doing this. You cloud eject your project or you can override the configuration of `create-react-app`. We will show both ways for completeion.

Regardless of wheter you choose to eject a project or override it's configuration, you will need the module `CopyWebpackPlugin`. Go to the root directory of the project and run:

```cmd
    npm install copy-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

Ejecting a project created using `create-react-app`:

If you are using a scaffolding tool to build your react enabled applications, you will need to eject your project so that you can access the `webpack.config.js` file. Go to the root of the `create-react-app` project and run:

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!!!**

```cmd
    npm run eject
```
 
 You should now have access to `webpack.config.js` in the newly created `./config` folder. Place the following code inside the `webpack.config.js` file, in the `plugins` array:

 ```javascript
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');

module.exports =  () => {

  // some config

  return {
    // more config

    plugins: [
      // even more config

      new CopyWebpackPlugin({
        patterns: [
          { from: '../node_modules/@glue42/gateway-web/web/gateway-web.js', to: '../build/glue/' },
          { from: '../node_modules/@glue42/worker-web/dist/worker.js', to: '../build/glue/' },
          { from: '../glue.config.json', to: '../build/glue/' },
       ]
     })
    ]
  };
};
 ```
Inside the root of your project, run:

```cmd
    node ./scripts/build.js
```

### 9.2. Deploying using webpack. Without ejecting application from create-react-app

Modifying `create-react-app` without ejecting, using `react-app-rewired`. This options does not require ejecting the project and maintains most of the benefist of having `create-react-app` managing your project's configuration:

**Note: If you've build your application on top of the already provides Stocks, StockDetails, and Client applications from the tutorial, they already have react-app-rewired installed!!!**

In the root of the `create-react-app` project, run the following command:

```cmd
 npm install react-app-rewired --save-dev
```

Again, in the root directory create `config-overrides.js` file and add the following code to it:

```javascript
    const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');

    module.exports = config => {
        config.plugins.push(new CopyWebpackPlugin({
            patterns: [
                { from: '../node_modules/@glue42/gateway-web/web/gateway-web.js', to: '../build/glue/' },
                { from: '../node_modules/@glue42/worker-web/dist/worker.js', to: '../build/glue/' },
                { from: '../glue.config.json', to: '../build/glue/' },
            ]
        }));
        return config;
    }
```

You need to go the `package.json` file inside of your root directory and change some of the `create-react-app` script commands: Replace the `start`, `build`, and `test` commands with:

```json
    {
        "scripts": {
            "start": "react-app-rewired start",
            "build": "react-app-rewired build",
            "test": "react-app-rewired test --env=jsdom",
        }
    }
```

Inside the root of your project, run:

```cmd
npm run build
```

### 9.3. Deploying using webpack. Project not created using create-react-app or other scaffolding tools

Go inside the `webpack.config.js` file and add this code to the `plugins` array.

 ```javascript
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');

module.exports =  () => {

  // some config

  return {
    // more config

    plugins: [
      // even more config

      new CopyWebpackPlugin({
        patterns: [
          { from: '../node_modules/@glue42/gateway-web/web/gateway-web.js', to: '../build/glue/' },
          { from: '../node_modules/@glue42/worker-web/dist/worker.js', to: '../build/glue/' },
          { from: '../glue.config.json', to: '../build/glue/' },
       ]
     })
    ]
  };
};
 ```

Then build your project.
